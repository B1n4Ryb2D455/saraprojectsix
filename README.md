# MyReads Project

## Ways to Interact or Develop:
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository to your machine *you will need a code editor*
3. Download the ZIP file *you must spin up a server from the command line to interact with this app*

## Description
An app similar to Goodreads used to track books a person is reading, wants to read, or has read. There is search function capability as well as the ability to move the books between shelves with a few clicks. This project was project six in the Google Udacity Front End Web developer nanodegree.

##Project Requirements
The project contained static starter code that must be converted to an interactive application; to meet submission requirements, the following features must have been implemented:
- search page has input field and behaves as a search page should
- the search field of the search page is interactive, books appear as the user types search criteria
- search results aren't shown if the text field is void of search criteria
- invalid queries are handled
- search still works even if a book has no thumbnail or author
- multiple words can be queried in the search bar
- when a book is selected, a user can move the book to the appropriate shelf from the search page (or the main page of the app)
- the correct shelf should be displayed when the user selects the button to move a book
- main page contains link to search page, which is shown when the link is clicked

## How the App was Built:
- The app was built React, CSS, HTML, Node.js, Visual Studio Code, Chrome's built-in dev tools, and used Git Bash to push changes to Github

- cloned project code to my local machine using Gitbash
- pushed the code up to my Github profile as Master
- ran 'npm install' and 'npm start' to spin up a local server
- created MainPage, SearchPage, and Books js files for individual components
- installed React router (using Node.js, then implementing in the app)

## Instructions for Interacting:
- search for a book using the search button in the bottom right hand corner of the application
- move books between shelves using the buttons to the bottom of each book, which will open a small drop-down menu
- you can navigate back to the main page using the back button in the search bar
